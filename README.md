# 🐍 Python Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains all the basic Python programming concepts I’ve learned and practiced — organized by topic in a beginner-friendly way.  
It's a personal archive of my learning, created not just to help myself, but also to support other beginners who are getting started with Python.

I created this repository to:
- Track and organize my learning.
- Revisit and revise key concepts anytime.
- Help beginners find topic-wise, simple Python examples.

## 📌 About This Repository

While learning Python, I wrote and saved code examples for every fundamental topic. Instead of keeping everything scattered, I organized them into folders based on topics — like variables, loops, functions, lists, and more.

This repository is **not a complete course**, but a structured **practice space** that can help:
- Reinforce the basics through example code.
- Make revision easier.
- Provide a clear learning path for beginners.
